<p>Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the array, comparing the current element to the next, swapping if needed, larger elements "bubble up" to the top.</p>
<p>Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of O(n^2), making it unsuitable for most data sets, especially large ones. </p>
